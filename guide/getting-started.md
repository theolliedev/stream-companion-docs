# Getting Started

This application is made to work with any streaming application, but as I am using Streamer.Bot for my own use, I will only be focusing on that.

## What you will need
- OpenAI API key ([OpenAI Api Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
- Streamer.Bot
- Speaker.Bot (optional)

## First Steps
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/theolliedev/stream-companion/releases) and install it.
2. Run the application, in the **Integration** section, click **Setup** under **OpenAI**.

That's it! The AI model should be up and running! Though the app cannot run by itself, checkout the next page to configure **Streamer.Bot**.
